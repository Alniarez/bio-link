# bio-link

## What

biol-link is planned to be a plain javascript "social media reference landing page" generator that anyone can use.

After generating a page it can be hosted freely on any of the multiple generous free hosting services available.

## Why

This project was sparked from the recent controversial collaboration between Linktree and OpenSea.

I wanted to create a self hosted alternative to Linktree, easy to use by non-tech savvy people.

Is any of this hypothetical free hosting free from evil and of pure morale? If not, why would this better than supporting a project integrating "the bad stuff from Web3.0"? I don't know... how could I know? 

## Where

Repo will be public on github.

Additional notes or tutorials will be available on this repository on on my own webtise.

## When

I don't know. I put more effort on this readme file than on anything else...
